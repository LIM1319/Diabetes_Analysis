# Diabetes Analysis Using Exploratory Data Techniques

## Overview

We employ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate the relationship between various health attributes and the likelihood of diabetes. The analysis includes summary statistics, correlation assessments, and visualizations.

## Approach:

1. **Data Collection:** The dataset consists of health information on Pima Indian women aged 21 and older.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data distribution and relationships among variables.
3. **Visualization:** Generating plots such as histograms, pair plots, and heatmaps to visualize the correlation and distribution of attributes.
4. **Observation:** Drawing insights based on the data patterns and correlations identified.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
